### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carl.  I'm a problem solver!

I'm a recent graduate of [the School of Code] (https://schoolofcode.co.uk) 4th cohort. Before becoming a full time Web Developer I was working in the print industry for 15 years, over 12 years of that time was spent as a Print Production Manager. Technology was constantly changing through the years and it was my job to adapt to the changing needs of the business and industry as a whole while working with a team in a fast paced environment. I have been working primarily with JavaScript, React on the frontend and mostly NodeJS/Express on the backend,  although the soft skills I have picked up during my time with the School of Code,  mean I can adapt to a new programming language quickly.
